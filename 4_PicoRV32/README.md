# Intro
This is mini version of AE350
# Toolchain
Toolchain taken from xPack (https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/)[https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/]
# Debugger
Used RV-Debugger Plus made by Sipeed.
I guess any other debugger should work (requires changes in openocd.cfg).
# Demo
Demo comes from Gowin reference guide. It is adopted to compile in Linux (original env used by Gowin is Windows).
